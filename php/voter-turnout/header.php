$description = "Previous University Student Government elections had seen a significant 
                increase of voter population in both Manila and Laguna campuses, yet the 
                turnout percentages remain around or barely above the midpoint. In the 
                past five years, the highest election turnout was 60.02 percent during 
                the 2021 Make-Up Elections, while the most recent 2022 Make-Up Elections 
                was barely validated at 51.83 percent.

                <br><br>

                The problem of the lack of voting participation from the student body has 
                been a longstanding problem for the USG. Back during the 2015 General Elections, 
                DLSU Comelec was forced to hold the start of office by the second term of 
                the academic year due to a plebiscite failure after receiving a voter turnout 
                of 35.90 percent, well below the required 51 percent. 

                <br><br>

                With barely any improvements, it remains a hurdle for next the administration 
                to figure out ways to reverse Lasalliansâ€™ indifference toward USG politics.";

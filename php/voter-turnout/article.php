        Previous University Student Government elections had seen- significant increases in voter
        population for both Manila and Laguna campuses, yet voter turnouts remain around or barely
        above the midpoint. In the past five years, the highest election turnout was 60.02 percent during
        the 2021 Make-Up Elections, while the most recent 2022 Make-Up Elections was barely
        validated despiteemie two-day extension at 51.83 percent.

        The problem of the lack of voting participation from the student body has been a longstanding
        problem for the USG. Back during the 2015 General Elections, DLSU Comelec was forced to
        hold the start of of office by the second term of the academic year due to a plebiscite failure after
        receiving a voter turnout of 35.90 percent, well below the 50 percent plus one requirement.

        The problem of only having a passable turnout is observed throughout most colleges and in the
        Laguna campus, with the exceptions being the School of Economics (SOE) and the Br. Andrew
        Gonzalez College of Education (BAGCED), whose voter turnout averages areis aboveat around
        70 percent.

        With barely any improvements, reversing Lasallians' indifference toward USG politics remains
        big hurdle thatfer the next administration must work hard to addressie figure out ways to-
        ifference toward USC polities.

                The point of a student government is to fill the gaps that the 
                school administration neglects to address. Student leaders 
                represent the student body. This should not be that hard; after
                 all, they are students as well. Aside from this, this 
                 “representative leadership” is a campaign promise that they have 
                 parroted since when the University Student Government (USG) was 
                 still the Student Council.

                So why, despite promises, is there a disconnect between the 
                student body and the USG? This is what <strong>The LaSallian</strong> aims to 
                tackle in this special. Perhaps an answer can be found through 
                an analysis of the two-party system, an investigation on the 
                mess surrounding the canceled General Elections 2023, and an
                 examination of the culture and social systems within the body 
                 that governs us.

                    We've come to find that this disconnect is two-fold. What 
                    cannot be seen in these pages is the denial of students to 
                    give their comments—because they had none. What cannot be 
                    read in the articles is a clarity of vision from student 
                    leaders—because the root of student apathy lies beyond their 
                    understanding.

                    This special does not just provide information for an 
                    educated guess to answer the question. <strong>The LaSallian</strong> also 
                    hopes to draw attention to this disconcerting issue, 
                    especially to the USG and anyone who aspires be a part of it. 
                    Most importantly, as the fourth estate, we wish to prompt 
                    the Lasallian community to be an active participant of the 
                    local sociopolitical sphere of the University. Much like how 
                    public opinion and national policy intertwine, so too can an 
                    engaged student body and an enlightened USG. Only then can 
                    these two disjoint forces find themselves on the same page.
